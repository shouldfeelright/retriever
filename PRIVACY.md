# Privacy Policy for Retriever

Last updated: November 22, 2025

## Data Collection

Retriever does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or user data.

## Third-Party Services

The extension makes requests to the following public APIs to provide domain lookup functionality:

- **Google Public DNS** (dns.google) - for DNS record lookups
- **RDAP.org** (rdap.org) - for domain registration data
- **Who.is** (who.is) - external link for WHOIS lookups
- **ICANN Lookup** (lookup.icann.org) - external link for ICANN lookups

These requests contain only the domain names you choose to look up. No personal information, browsing history, or usage data is collected or transmitted.

## Permissions

Retriever requests the following permissions:

- **activeTab**: To read the current tab's URL when you click "Use Current Tab"
- **tabs**: To query the active tab information
- **host_permissions**: To make DNS and RDAP API requests to the services listed above

These permissions are used solely to provide the core functionality of the extension and are not used to collect or transmit personal data.

## Data Storage

Retriever does not store any data locally or remotely. All lookups are performed in real-time and results are not saved.

## Third-Party Data Sharing

No data is shared with third parties. API requests to DNS and RDAP services contain only domain names that you explicitly choose to look up.
